## Development

To setup the project, clone this repo and import into Android Studio, or 
in Android Studio goto File -> New -> Project from Version Control.

## Contributing

**IMPORTANT: Do _not_ commit directly to main branch. Checkout a new 
branch and open pull requests to merge to main.** 
*I would protect the main branch, but the repository needs to be public 
or the org needs to be paid.*

We will be feature branching. Open a new branch and pull request to merge 
to main.

If .gitignore isn't working, proceed to untrack all files in .gitignore 
using the following:

```
git rm -r --cached .
git add .
git commit -m "My .gitignore is fixed besties!!!"
```
